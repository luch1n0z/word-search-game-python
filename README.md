# word-search-game-python
hi all, i'm creating a word search game in python, and i'm stuck at the point where when the user enters the word and the word is present diagonally to the left of the main one, i should put asterisks to highlight that word, for each character of the word, i spent a lot of time but nothing to do. gpt and bard chat can't help me either.
