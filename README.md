# word-search-game-python

##Description 
word search game is a python game where there is a 10x10 grid of randomly generated letters (for now, later I will modify it to make the letters form meaningful words), the user has to find the words in the grid.
I'm stuck at the point where when the user enters the word and the word is present diagonally to the left of the main one, i should put asterisks to highlight that word, for each character of the word, i spent a lot of time but nothing to do. gpt and bard chat can't help me either.
